## Question

The objective of this repo is to have a function that will convert an array of
integers into an array of strings representing the phonetic equivalent of the integer.

For example:

Given an array: [3, 25, 209], print “Three,TwoFive,TwoZeroNine” into stdout.

Given an array: [10, 300, 5], print “OneZero,ThreeZeroZero,Five” into stdout.

## How to run:

1. Clone the repo with `https://github.com/GordonLei/kg_GordonLei_2022.git`

2. Navigate to the root directory of this repo

3. Type `node main.js <number> <number> <number> ...` into the command line where everything after "main.js" are integers.

4. For example, these are valid commands to type in the command line:
   - `node main.js 3 25 209` which returns Three, TwoFive, TwoZeroNine
   - `node main.js 10 300 5` which returns OneZero, ThreeZeroZero,Five
